# Introduction

This guide covers how to run Confidential Containers workloads across supported cloud and virtualization environments by using the Cloud API Adaptor (CAA) and the peer-pods runtime. 
This deployment model provides strong workload isolation without tying the Kubernetes worker nodes to a particular virtualization or confidential-computing technology.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
The capabilities available to a workload depend on the infrastructure provider, region, machine type, and guest image. 
A PodVM can use a supported Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), such as Intel® TDX, AMD SEV-SNP, or IBM Secure Execution, where available. 
Some environments also support non-confidential VMs for development and testing. 
Consult the provider-specific guide for current requirements and limitations.

At a high level, the Cloud API Adaptor integrates with a provider's compute API or virtualization backend to provision a suitable VM for each pod.
The CAA then coordinates with the peer-pods runtime to run the pod workload in that dedicated PodVM. 
When the selected environment provides a TEE, this architecture can protect the workload from the host or hypervisor and support attestation.

Application manifests remain largely portable between environments. 
Provider-specific differences are handled during cluster setup and CAA configuration, including credentials, networking, regions or zones, instance types, VM images, and confidential-computing settings.

The provider-specific sections describe these differences and identify compatible machine types and isolation technologies where available.


## Cloud API Adaptor

The Cloud API Adaptor is an implementation of the [remote hypervisor interface](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/main/src/runtime/virtcontainers/remote.go) of [Kata Containers](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers).
The CAA solution enables the creation of Kata Containers VMs on machines without requiring bare metal worker nodes or nested virtualization support.

The background and description of the components involved in `peer pods` can be found in the [CoCo architecture documentation](https://github.com/confidential-containers/cloud-api-adaptor/blob/main/docs/architecture.md).


## PodVM

In Confidential Containers, a **PodVM** is the *confidential virtual machine created to host a single Kubernetes Pod*.
It is the VM boundary used by the peer-pods deployment model: when a pod is scheduled to a Confidential Containers runtime class, the runtime provisions a dedicated VM for that pod and then starts the pod’s containers **inside** the VM.

A PodVM typically includes:

- a minimal guest OS,
- a container runtime (for example, containerd), and
- an agent that receives the Kubernetes pod specification and launches the containers in the guest.

From Kubernetes’ point of view, you still create a normal `Pod` (or a `Deployment`, `Job`, etc.).
The PodVM is an implementation detail of the runtime that provides a stronger isolation boundary than traditional containers:

- **No shared host kernel**: the pod runs with its own guest kernel instead of the worker node’s kernel.
- **Dedicated VM boundary**: the pod’s execution is isolated from other pods by virtualization rather than just namespaces/cgroups.
- **Confidential computing support**: when backed by Intel® TDX, memory inside the PodVM is protected from the host/hypervisor, and the platform can be attested before secrets are released.

In this guide, PodVMs are created on demand by the peer-pods runtime. The Cloud API Adaptor uses the configured infrastructure backend to provision and manage the VM instances that run those workloads.


## Peer Pods

**Peer Pods** is a Confidential Containers deployment model where *each Kubernetes Pod runs inside its own dedicated confidential VM* (a PodVM).

Operationally, when you deploy a pod using a Confidential Containers `RuntimeClass`, the peer-pods components:

- request the creation of a PodVM for that pod, using the configured isolation technology where available,
- boot a minimal guest environment in the PodVM, and
- start the pod’s containers inside the PodVM rather than on the Kubernetes worker node.

Across managed Kubernetes, self-managed clusters, and supported virtualization environments, the Cloud API Adaptor provides the infrastructure integration needed to provision the VM instances used for these PodVMs.

Key properties of Peer Pods:

- **Strong isolation per pod**: Each pod gets a separate VM boundary. When a supported TEE is enabled, it can also protect the pod's memory from the host or hypervisor.
- **Kubernetes-native workflow**: You deploy standard Kubernetes resources (Pods/Deployments/Jobs). The runtime handles VM lifecycle without changing application manifests.
- **Attestation-ready**: When supported by the selected TEE and environment, the PodVM can be attested to verify platform and workload identity before sensitive data is released.
- **Infrastructure-independent architecture**: Provider-specific provisioning is handled by the Cloud API Adaptor, allowing peer pods to use compatible VM types without requiring nested virtualization on Kubernetes worker nodes.

The following provider-specific sections cover cluster prerequisites, enabling Confidential Containers, selecting compatible VM types and images, configuring available isolation technologies, and deploying sample workloads using peer pods.
